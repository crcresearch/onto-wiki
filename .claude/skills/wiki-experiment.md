description: File experiment results to the wiki following the SCHEMA Ingest procedure. Use after an experiment run produces metrics, ablations, or comparisons worth keeping as durable project memory.
---

An experiment run has produced results worth remembering. File them to the wiki so future sessions can build on them rather than re-deriving.

## What to capture

Identify the experiment from the conversation or ask the user:

- Which experiment / variant ran (e.g., MuSiQue v3 with entity-overlap rank, BM25 drift temperature sweep)
- Configuration used (parameters, seeds, dataset, scale, restart probability, type weights, softmax temperatures)
- Headline metrics. For MuSiQue, report per hop count (2 / 3 / 4 hop). Standard metrics: MRR, recall@k, multi_hop_hit@k, any-gold@pool, all-gold@pool
- What changed vs. the previous run on the same benchmark
- What was surprising or worth flagging
- Path to the experiment's `results/` directory

## Procedure

Follow the Ingest procedure defined in `wiki/{{REPO_NAME}}.wiki/SCHEMA_{{REPO_NAME}}.md`. The steps below are pointers, not a substitute for SCHEMA:

1. Read existing wiki pages for this experiment first. Likely candidates: the benchmark page (`HotpotQA-Benchmark` or `MuSiQue-Benchmark`), the headline results page (`MuSiQue-PoC-Results` or similar), comparison pages (`Drift-Variants-MuSiQue`, `Independent-vs-Chained-Retrieval`), and the concept pages whose claims the result bears on (`Softmax-Normalization`, `Named-Entity-Concept-Extraction`, `Entity-Overlap-Ranking`, `Typed-Predicate-Ontology`, `RAG-Sanity-Check`, etc.). Integrate rather than duplicate.
2. Create or update an experiment-results page. Frontmatter: `type: synthesis` or `type: entity`; `up:` pointing to the benchmark page; typed edges (`supports:` / `criticizes:` / `extends:`) when the result confirms or refutes a prior claim on another page.
3. Page body should include: configuration, headline metrics, what changed vs. previous run, what was surprising or worth flagging, link to the experiment's `results/` directory, link to the relevant commit hash.
4. **Honest reporting.** Bad results, contradicted claims, and worsened metrics get filed truthfully, not polished. Per CLAUDE.md and the global rule: never report accuracy from projections, only from real script outputs.
5. Update concept pages whose claims this result bears on. If a new result contradicts a wiki claim, update or flag the affected page, do not leave the contradiction.
6. Fix cross-references in both directions on every affected page (`[[Page]]` in frontmatter, `[Display](Page)` in body).
7. Update `index_{{REPO_NAME}}.md` with one-line descriptions of new pages in the right category.
8. Append a `## [YYYY-MM-DD] update | Experiment name` entry to `log_{{REPO_NAME}}.md`. The first bullet is the attribution line `- by: <name> via claude-code`, where `<name>` is the output of `git config user.name` in the wiki repo (read it, do not invent it). Then 2 to 5 bullets describing the run. See "Log Entry Attribution" in `SCHEMA_{{REPO_NAME}}.md`.
9. Optionally rebuild the knowledge graph: `./scripts/kg/build-graph.sh`.
10. **Run the Verification Gate** at `wiki/agents/verification-gate.md` over every page created or edited. Do not commit until all criteria pass. The gate catches projection-as-fact, missing corpus tags on numerical claims, missing back-references, and missing log/index entries — the failure modes the discipline-gates Universal Rationalizations table enumerates.
11. Commit in the wiki's own git repo in two steps: first stage and commit the page and index changes by name with a descriptive message, then stage and commit the `log_{{REPO_NAME}}.md` entry on its own. One commit per log entry keeps `git blame` on the log a faithful per-entry record (see "Log Entry Attribution" in SCHEMA). Do not push unless the user requests.

A single experiment write-up typically touches 5 to 15 pages.

## When to skip

- The run was a debug rerun with no new information.
- The run failed before producing meaningful metrics. (Record the failure mode separately if it teaches something about the architecture.)
- Configuration is identical to a previous run already filed.

## After running

Tell the user which wiki pages were created or updated, summarize the headline result in one sentence, and remind that the wiki commit is local. **When pushing (only if asked), follow the procedure at `wiki/agents/wiki-write-protocol.md`** — it uses the `wiki_push` wrapper to handle multi-writer collisions, mechanical union-merge for `index_*`/`log_*` files, and content-conflict deferral to the agent's next turn.
