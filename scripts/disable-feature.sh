# disable-feature.sh — Symmetric removal of a feature previously enabled
# in a project derived from the llm-wiki-memory template.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/disable-feature.sh <feature-name>
#   ./scripts/disable-feature.sh -h | --help
#
# Effects (mirror of enable-feature.sh / install_feature):
#   - Removes the files copied by install (files.destination)
#   - Removes the tests copied by install (tests.destination)
#   - Removes the CI workflow file
#   - Removes the CLAUDE.md section between the feature's paired markers
#   - Removes the feature name from .features-enabled
#
# Idempotent: removing a feature that is not enabled is a no-op success.
#
# Run from the project root (the directory containing CLAUDE.md).
