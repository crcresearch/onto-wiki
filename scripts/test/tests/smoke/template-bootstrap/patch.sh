# Smoke test: template bootstrap.
# Clones the real llm-wiki-memory-template (or uses local copy via
# MVP_TEMPLATE_LOCAL), runs instantiate.sh to bootstrap a fresh derivative,
# then verifies the template's own scripts produced expected outputs.
#
# This is the answer to template issue #5's "create-mode run of init-wiki.sh
# in a throwaway repo, asserting the wiki files and the expected SCHEMA
# sections are generated" request, scoped to what can run without an LLM
# in the loop.
#
# Inputs:  SANDBOX env var. lib/template.sh's clone_template function.
# Effects: $SANDBOX/template/ contains a freshly-bootstrapped derivative
#          if the clone succeeded. assertions.sh inspects it.
#
# Idempotent.

# and needs to load them again.)
