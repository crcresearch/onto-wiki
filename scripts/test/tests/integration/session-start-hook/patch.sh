# Integration test patch: SessionStart hook content injection.
#
# Stages two fake derived projects in the sandbox so assertions.sh can
# verify the hook's behaviour end to end:
#
#   $SANDBOX/session-start-hook/fakerepo/         — wiki sub-repo present
#       wiki/fakerepo.wiki/index_fakerepo.md      stub index
#       wiki/fakerepo.wiki/log_fakerepo.md        stub log with 7 entries
#       hook.sh                                   rendered hook (sed-substituted)
#
#   $SANDBOX/session-start-hook/fakerepo-nowiki/  — wiki sub-repo absent
#       hook.sh                                   rendered hook (sed-substituted)
#
# The hook is rendered via the same sed substitution that
# wiki/agents/claude-code/setup.sh applies at install time, so the test
# exercises the real install path's output. The assertions confirm the
# hook prints the orientation reminder, injects the index, emits the
# last 5 of 7 log entries (not the first 5), and gracefully skips the
# index/log blocks when the wiki sub-repo is absent.

Chronological record of wiki activity.

## [2026-01-01] create | Entry 1 — oldest, should NOT appear in hook output
- by: Test User via claude-code
- This is the oldest entry. With 7 entries total and last-5 logic, it gets skipped.

## [2026-01-02] ingest | Entry 2 — also too old, should NOT appear
- by: Test User via claude-code
- Second-oldest. Also skipped.

## [2026-02-01] ingest | Entry 3 — first of the last 5
- by: Test User via claude-code
- The hook output should START here.

## [2026-03-01] ingest | Entry 4
- by: Test User via claude-code
- Mid-range entry.

## [2026-04-01] lint | Entry 5
- by: Test User via claude-code
- Mid-range entry.

## [2026-05-01] ingest | Entry 6
- by: Test User via claude-code
- Mid-range entry.

## [2026-06-01] ingest | Entry 7 — most recent
- by: Test User via claude-code
