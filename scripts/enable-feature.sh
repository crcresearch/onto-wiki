# enable-feature.sh — Retroactive entry point for enabling a feature in a
# project that was instantiated from the llm-wiki-memory template.
#
# Use this when the feature was not selected at instantiation time (via
# instantiate.sh --features=) and you want to add it later.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/enable-feature.sh <feature-name>
#   ./scripts/enable-feature.sh --list
#   ./scripts/enable-feature.sh -h | --help
#
# Effects:
#   - Reads features/<name>/feature.json
#   - Copies feature files into the project
#   - Inserts a section into CLAUDE.md between paired markers
#   - Copies the feature's CI workflow into .github/workflows/
#   - Records the feature name in .features-enabled
#   - Prints system dependency install instructions
#
# Idempotent: re-running with the same feature is a no-op success.
#
# Run from the project root (the directory containing CLAUDE.md).
